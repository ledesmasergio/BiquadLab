# BiquadLab
The BiquadLab software is an interactive laboratory to design, analyze, and test 
Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) Filters

It provides support for: Butterworth filters, Chebyshev filters and Elliptic filters
It is possible to setup:
 1. The cut frequency
 2. The stop frequency
 3. The amplitude of the ripples in the passband
 4. The maximum gain in the stopband (or minimum attenuation)
 
 It is possible to:
  1. Visualize the frequency response magnitude
  2. Visualize the group delay of the filter
  3. Visualize the position of the poles and zeros of the filter
  4. Compute the coefficients of the biquad sections
  5. Test the filter in real time using a Wave audio file
